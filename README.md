Title: Algorithmic Trading and Backtesting
Techniques:Trend Following Strategy (Moving Average), Backtesting the
Trading Strategy (Implementation of a Simple Backtester)
Overview and Problem Statement: Algorithmic trading is a style that
utilizes the computer's ability to process data quickly and reacts faster to
changes in the market. This approach is generally based on hard data
rather than forecasts or opinions. So it just takes a data stream that comes
into the algorithm. It processes it quickly and then it makes a decision
whether or not to buy or sell. Some major categories of algorithmic trading
are: mean reversion, momentum strategy, statistical arbitrage, trend
following strategies. Here, using the trend following strategy, calculate the
moving average to evaluate the market and the prices, by applying it to two
time periods, over the period of a certain number of days.
Backtesting the Trading Strategy: Backtesting refers to applying a
trading system to historical data to verify how a system would have
performed during the specified time period. For example, in the simple
moving average crossover system, the trader would be able to input (or
change) the lengths of the two moving averages used in the system. The
trader could backtest to determine which lengths of moving averages would
have performed the best on the historical data. In this project, the
participants are expected to (i) visualize the variations in the data and (ii)
obtain the simple moving average for 12 days and 26 days (iii) convert the
stock price data to returns and check the position of the 12-day MA (fast)
with respect to the 26-day MA (slow) and (iv) visualize the closing price,
short and long moving averages and (v) implement a simple backtester
(create a portfolio which can generate orders and manages the profit and
loss) (vi) visualize the original data series and backtest series to check the
performance of trading strategy.
